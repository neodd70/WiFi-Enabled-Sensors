# WiFi-Enabled-Sensors
These are WiFi enabled sensors using the ESP8266 WiFi module. Using the onboard micro-controller built into the ESP8266-esp01
and the newly added ability to program the ESP8266 with the Arduino IDE you can add a sensor to the ESP8266 and use it as a 
stand alone controller to transmit over WiFi the pin-state of the GPIO0 pin controlled by the sensor.
